## Time Series Analysis Project
# Overview
This project demonstrates time series analysis techniques on sales data, combining sales records with products attributes to uncover insights and patterns. The analysis is performed using Python with popular data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, StatsModels, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Features
Data loading and merging of sales records with products attributes

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Time series visualizations and decompositions

Statistical modelling and correlation analysis

Feature engineering and normalizations

## Technologies Used
1. Python 3.5
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas (Data manipulation)
4. NumPy (Numerical computing)
5. StatsModels (Statistical modeling)
6. Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Data Sources
The project uses two main datasets:
1. sales.txt - Contains sales transaction records including:
    - Country
    - Article ID
    - Sales quantities
    - Pricing informations

    - Dates

2. article_attributes.txt - Contains products metadata including:
    - Product categories
    - Cost informations
    - Style and sizing
    - Color information (RGB values)
